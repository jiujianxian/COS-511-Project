 abstract = {The paper aims to give a unified account of the central concepts in recent work on bandit processes and dynamic allocation indices; to show how these reduce some previously intractable problems to the problem of calculating such indices; and to describe how these calculations may be carried out. Applications to stochastic scheduling, sequential clinical trials and a class of search problems are discussed.},

abstract="The multi-armed bandit problem for a gambler is to decide which arm of a K-slot machine to pull to maximize his total reward in a series of trials. Many real-world learning and optimization problems can be modeled in this way. Several strategies or algorithms have been proposed as a solution to this problem in the last two decades, but, to our knowledge, there has been no common evaluation of these algorithms.",
